For more info about the technicalities, visit my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ramluislmarmol/soda_manufacturing_dashboard) for this project.

### Key Insights
- 55.91% of Total Downtime is caused by Operator Errors. Removing these will result in an 81.11 average production time, a 20.11% improvement.
- Downtime per hour peaks at noon (12:00pm) and at closing hours (7:00pm) with a similar trend for operator-caused downtime.
- Machine adjustment accounts for the highest contribution for operator-caused downtime. Interestingly, Mac accounts for the highest contribution in batch change, but the lowest contribution to machine adjustment.
- RE-600 and LE-600 has noticeably high ratio of operator-caused downtime. OR-600 is also commendable. Whereas DC-600 has a high ratio of machine caused downtime.

### My Recommendations
- Examine the area during the noon and closing hours to find the root cause of the spike. Possible causes may include but not limited to;
  - the rising Philippine temperature, making working conditions for laborers uncomfortable during noon,
  - “End of work” effect, where operators (anticipating the end of their shift) may psychologically disengage from tasks.
- Operator training to reduce the effect of man-made error. Machine adjustment training for Charlie, Dee and Dennis and batch change training for Mac is recommended. Adding standard operating procedures and kanban system may prove useful.
- Process inspection and study especially for RB-600 and LE-600 is recommended to help identify possible work errors. DC-600 machine inspection is also recommended.

- Prepared and aggregated customer data in Microsoft Excel to identify key drivers of customer churn. 
- Developed a comprehensive Excel dashboard with dynamic charts, visualizing churn patterns and presenting actionable insights for retention strategies.

## Analyzing Motorcyle Part Sales
[Queries are hosted in DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/09c538e2-93e6-4498-ba97-ec3e0b05e031/edit)

- Used PostgreSQL to create queries that obtain data from a fictional motorcycle company. Used data management techniques to clean and organize the data–before using more advanced functions to answer specific business questions.
- Communicated business concepts like net revenue, most profitable payment method, and most ordered motorcycle parts to create actionable insights, relevant to different departments in the company.
